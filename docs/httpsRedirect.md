Redirects the page to HTTPS if its currently in HTTP. Also, pressing the back button doesn't take it back to the HTTP page as its replaced in the history.

Use `location.protocol` to get the protocol currently being used. If it's not HTTPS, use `location.replace()` to replace the existing page with the HTTPS version of the page. Use `location.href` to get the full address, split it with `String.prototype.split()` and remove the protocol part of the URL.

```ts title="typescript"
const httpsRedirect = () => {
  if (location.protocol !== "https:")
    location.replace("https://" + location.href.split("//")[1]);
};
```

```ts title="typescript"
httpsRedirect(); // If you are on http://mydomain.com, you are redirected to https://mydomain.com
```
